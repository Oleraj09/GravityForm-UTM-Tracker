## Why Use This Plugin

Gravity Forms has a built-in **dynamic population** feature that can capture UTM data. However, there’s a limitation: if a user navigates to another page and then returns to submit the form, the UTM parameters may be lost and not stored in the form.  

This plugin solves that problem by **persistently storing UTM parameters** as users browse your website. The UTM data remains available and automatically populates the Gravity Form fields **until the form is submitted**, ensuring that no UTM data is lost even if the user visits multiple pages.
